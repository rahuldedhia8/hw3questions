1.	What code draws the blades of grass?
function draw() {
  stroke(random(60, 70), 100, 90);
 line(x, height-10, x + random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
2.	What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
if (random() > 0.999) {
    noStroke();
It comes by when the grass blades reach the height of 10. 

3.	What's the point of the h variable?
Height is set as a variable because the value assigned to it can be altered and manipulated later in the code as per your requirements. It lays a foundation which the developer can later use to do things more efficiently 

4.	What do the three numerical arguments of colorMode do?
The color mode arguments decide the Hue, Saturation and Brightness Values. They are all set to 100 which means it will be white. If it were closer to a single digit value, the color would become darker. 

5.	What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h)? Why is it there?
In the second argument, it decides where the grass will start growing. From the height of of the ground. 

In the fourth argument, It decides the height of the grass blade. If it was height-10-random, it would mean that the grass blades will grow for 10 px randomly. If the value is changed, the height changes.
