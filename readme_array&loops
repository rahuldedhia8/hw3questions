If an array has 5 elements in it, what are the valid index values for the array? (Hint: what's always the first index value?)

What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?

For loops are for when you know the amount of times you want something to loop, they have pre-condition for ex, if the input 
is x then the output should be x+1. While loops allow you to set conditions like reaching a certain value, etc.
